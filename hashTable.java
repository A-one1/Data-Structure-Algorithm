public class hashTable {


    // hash table- a large array in which data is stored based on it's hash index
    // hash index - an index into the hash table that is calulcated based on a property of the data
    // hash function - generates a hash index
    // collision- when 2 unique peices of data generate the same hash index
//     a good function minimizes collisions (dispense the data evenly in the memory)
//     make efficient use of memory(avoid wasting memory at front or back of the table)
